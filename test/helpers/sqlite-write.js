// instead of spawning the sqlite3 CLI once per statement. The per-statement
// spawn dominated the wall time of the sqlite-backed parser tests (the copilot
// session-store suite alone spent ~40s in spawnSync). Fixture creation is the
// only thing that changes — the code under test still reads through
// src/lib/sqlite-reader (CLI-first), so parser fidelity is preserved.
//
// node:sqlite emits a one-time ExperimentalWarning on first require; harmless in
// tests (it goes to stderr and does not fail the run).
